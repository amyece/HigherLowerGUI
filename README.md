# HigherLowerGUI

This is the GUI to run alongside the Higher Lower Card Game Api.

IMPORTANT: Due to CORS the GUI MUST be run on https://localhost:4200

In game.service.ts you will find the Api URL, if you need to change port please edit this accordingly.

I chose Angular for this coding task as I like the structure of components, services and modules. Styling is quite basic, but it was all custom CSS. To improve I would've liked to add a 'High Score' display on the screen, and if more time allowed I would've implemented a popup or modal dialog to signify the end of the game and to prompt to start a new game or quit the current game. The card design also could have been more intricate, however it is obvious with my design what each card is supposed to be!
